        Love is that condition in which the happiness of another person is
        essential to your own.

      <Text as="p" size={6}>
        Beauty is in the eye of the beholder and it may be necessary from time
        to time to give a stupid or misinformed beholder a black eye.
      </Text>
      <Text as="p" size={5}>
        There is never a time or place for true love. It happens accidentally,
        in a heartbeat, in a single flashing, throbbing moment.
      </Text>
      <Text as="p" size={4}>
        It is impossible to live without failing at something, unless you live
        so cautiously that you might as well not have lived at all - in which
        case, you fail by default.

        Sometimes, you read a book and it fills you with this weird evangelical
        zeal, and you become convinced that the shattered world will never be
        put back together unless and until all living humans read the book.

        Here's to the crazy ones. The misfits. The rebels. The troublemakers.
        The round pegs in the square holes. The ones who see things differently.
        They're not fond of rules. And they have no respect for the status quo.
        You can quote them, disagree with them, glorify or vilify them. About
        the only thing you can't do is ignore them. Because they change things.
        They push the human race forward. And while some may see them as the
        crazy ones, we see genius. Because the people who are crazy enough to
        think they can change the world, are the ones who do.

        You may not be her first, her last, or her only. She loved before she
        may love again. But if she loves you now, what else matters? She's not
        perfect—you aren't either, and the two of you may never be perfect
        together but if she can make you laugh, cause you to think twice, and
        admit to being human and making mistakes, hold onto her and give her the
        most you can. She may not be thinking about you every second of the day,
        but she will give you a part of her that she knows you can break—her
        heart. So don't hurt her, don't change her, don't analyze and don't
        expect more than she can give. Smile when she makes you happy, let her
        know when she makes you mad, and miss her when she's not there.
